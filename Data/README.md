    Summary: This feature class/shapefile represents electric power transmission lines. Transmission Lines are the system of structures, wires, insulators and associated hardware that carry electric energy from one point to another in an electric power system. Lines are operated at relatively high voltages varying from 69 kV up to 765 kV, and are capable of transmitting large quantities of electricity over long distances. Underground transmission lines are included where sources were available.

Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (2020). All Places of Worship (2020) [Data file]. Retrieved from https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/all-places-of-worship

    Summary: The All Places of Worship dataset was created from the IRS master files containing the public national record of all 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations (found at https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organizations-business-master-file-extract-eo-bmf). The dataset was queried to include only places of worship and geocoded the dataset using the reported places of worship addresses to create a geospatially enabled All Places of Worship dataset. The dataset was delivered to the Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD), and the HIFLD Support Team (HST) performed some quality control (QC) tasks on the dataset, such as populating metadata based on the IRS Exempt Organizations Business Master File Extract (EO BMF).
